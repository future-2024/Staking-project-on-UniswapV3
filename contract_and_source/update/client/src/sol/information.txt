I mean yes, that part only

1. When the user clicks on connect wallet, we need to show availale LP token automatically in the deposit field already, so user donâ€™t need to check and enter it manually before depositing.
2. The amount of haha available to harvest should be shown in the fields

# We will have to show APR % we can show that only based on available $haha to harvest showing these fields is pretty standard in any farming page
# If we need to change the contract code in order to show these, we will have to make the necessary adjustments
# because these things are the most basic stuff of farming.

# APR = [(HahaRewardsPerMinute X 60 X 24 X 365)/TotalHahaLPStaked)] X 100

# So to calculate APR you just need to fetch the variable HahaRewardsPerMinute and TotalHahaStaked in the contract


# DailyRewardsAmount is CONSTANT
# So PerMinuteReward is CONSTANT/(24X60)

# So individual user reward is 

# UserStake/TotalStake X PerMinuteReward X CurrentTime - LastTimeHarvested X TaxRate-100
